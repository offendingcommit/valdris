# The Heartlands

*Where Ancient Glory Shapes Modern Power, Heart of the Golden Realm*

---

## Overview

**The Heartlands** form the political and cultural center of [[Valdris]], a vast fertile depression dominated by [[Thymeris the Golden]], the greatest of all [[Architect Ruins]]. This region serves as the beating heart of the continent, where the most powerful [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms]] vie for control of ancient wonders and where the marriage of [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology and human ambition reaches its most spectacular heights.

The Heartlands encompass the legendary **Whispering Valley**, so named for the constant, subtle harmonics that emanate from the great golden city. Here, morning mist carries the sound of distant gears, and the very soil seems enriched by proximity to ancient marvels. This is where [[Valdris]]'s destiny is written, where the [[Gear-Crowned]] nobility hold court among impossible spires, and where the continent's future hangs in the balance between human ambition and ancient mystery.

Since the [[Timeline|Recent Awakening]], the Heartlands have become the epicenter of continental change, as dormant ruins stir to life and the balance of power shifts like sand in an hourglass.

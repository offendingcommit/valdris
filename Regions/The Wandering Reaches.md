# The Wandering Reaches

*Where Gardens Walk and Wisdom Follows the Endless Road*

---

## Overview

**The Wandering Reaches** encompass the vast northern territories of [Valdris](Valdris.md), a land of ancient forests, windswept plains, and ruins that refuse to stay in one place. This rugged region serves as home to the [Wanderer Confederations](Wanderer%20Confederations.md), whose mobile communities follow the shifting paths between dangers and opportunities across an ever-changing landscape.

The Reaches are defined by their embrace of motion and adaptation. Here, the legendary [Walking Gardens of Yss'andra](Walking%20Gardens%20of%20Yss%27andra.md) roam across the countryside on hundreds of spider-like legs, leaving trails of impossible vegetation in their wake. This is a land where survival depends on knowledge of ever-shifting routes, where wisdom is measured by one's ability to read the patterns of wandering ruins, and where freedom is found in the endless horizon.

Since the [Recent Awakening](Timeline.md), the Wandering Reaches have become both more dangerous and more vital, as ancient routes shift unpredictably and new paths open to reveal wonders long hidden beneath the northern ice.

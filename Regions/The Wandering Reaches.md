# The Wandering Reaches

*Where Gardens Walk and Wisdom Follows the Endless Road*

---

## Overview

**The Wandering Reaches** encompass the vast northern territories of [[Valdris]], a land of ancient forests, windswept plains, and ruins that refuse to stay in one place. This rugged region serves as home to the [[Political Systems/Wanderer Confederations]], whose mobile communities follow the shifting paths between dangers and opportunities across an ever-changing landscape.

The Reaches are defined by their embrace of motion and adaptation. Here, the legendary [[Walking Gardens of Yss'andra]] roam across the countryside on hundreds of spider-like legs, leaving trails of impossible vegetation in their wake. This is a land where survival depends on knowledge of ever-shifting routes, where wisdom is measured by one's ability to read the patterns of wandering ruins, and where freedom is found in the endless horizon.

Since the [[Timeline|Recent Awakening]], the Wandering Reaches have become both more dangerous and more vital, as ancient routes shift unpredictably and new paths open to reveal wonders long hidden beneath the northern ice.

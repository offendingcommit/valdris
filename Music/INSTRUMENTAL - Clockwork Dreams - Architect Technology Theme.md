[Mechanical Intro]
Soft ticking, gears engaging
Clockwork startup sequence beginning
Single brass note emerges

[Brass Fanfare]
French horns announce the awakening
Trumpets join with mechanical precision
Clockwork percussion enters with tick-tock rhythm

[Rhythmic Verse]
Full brass section in intricate patterns
Clockwork percussion drives the tempo
Crystalline chimes accent the gears turning
Orchestral strings provide mechanical texture

[Soaring Chorus - Instrumental]
Full orchestra swells with triumphant brass
Clockwork percussion reaches full complexity
Crystalline chimes cascade like precision clockwork
Steampunk orchestration at its peak

[Precision Bridge - Instrumental]
Mechanical precision takes center stage
Gear-turning rhythms slow and deliberate
Solo brass instruments showcase intricate patterns
Building tension through controlled dynamics

[Triumphant Build - Instrumental]
Orchestral crescendo builds with clockwork intensity
All sections unite in clockwork symphony
Brass fanfares echo through mechanical chambers
Percussion drives toward technological triumph

[Mechanical Outro]
Gradual winding down of the great machine
Clockwork percussion slows to gentle ticking
Final brass chord resonates
Last gear click marks the end

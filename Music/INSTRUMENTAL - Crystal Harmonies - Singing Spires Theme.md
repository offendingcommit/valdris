## Song Structure Description

```
An ethereal orchestral piece capturing the haunting beauty of the Singing Spires of Kelathon. Begins with delicate glass instrument chimes and crystalline resonance, building through layers of string harmonies and ethereal choir vocalizations. The composition follows a hypnotic progression from crystalline intro through mysterious verses to otherworldly climax, featuring wordless harmonies that mirror the spires' ancient songs. Glass instruments provide crystal-like textures while haunting string arrangements create atmospheric depth. Ethereal choir elements use vocalizations and wordless sounds to evoke the supernatural voices echoing from the spires. The piece culminates in full harmonic convergence before fading to distant crystal echoes, maintaining the mysterious and supernatural atmosphere throughout.

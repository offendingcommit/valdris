## Lyrics

```lyrics
[Intro]
[raucous accordion intro with tavern crowd]

[Verse 1]
[solo male voice, building energy]
What'll it be, me lads tonight?
Ale that's brown or wine that's bright?
Or shall we try the Tinker's brew
That glows like ruins, crystal blue?

[Chorus]
[full tavern crowd, drunken singing]
Drink it down, drink it down
Finest spirits in the town
Toast the Architects of old
And the mysteries they've told
(drink it down!) (drink it down!)

[Verse 2]
[confident storytelling voice]
First it tastes of copper springs
Then of strange mechanical things
By the third cup you'll swear you hear
The voices of a distant year

[Chorus]
[louder crowd participation]
Drink it down, drink it down
Finest spirits in the town
Toast the Architects of old
And the mysteries they've told
(drink it down!) (drink it down!)

[Bridge]
[fiddle solo with crowd clapping]
[stomping and cheering]
(one more round!) (one more round!)
(best brew in town!) (best brew in town!)

[Verse 3]
[contemplative but jovial]
When morning comes you'll find your head
Full of dreams both gold and red
And blueprints drawn in morning dew
From the magic Tinker's brew

[Final Chorus]
[entire tavern singing together]
Drink it down, drink it down
Finest spirits in the town
Toast the Architects of old
And the mysteries they've told
(to the brew!) (to the brew!)

[Outro]
[drunken singing fade with accordion]
(tinker's brew!) (tinker's brew!)
```

## Song Structure Description

```structure
The song begins with a raucous accordion intro backed by fiddle, immediately establishing the Irish pub atmosphere with ambient tavern crowd noise. The first verse starts with a solo male voice building energy as he poses the question about the mysterious brew. The chorus explodes with full tavern participation, featuring drunken crowd singing with call-and-response background vocals shouting "drink it down!" The second verse continues the storytelling tradition with confident vocals describing the brew's magical effects, leading to an even louder chorus with increased crowd participation. The bridge features a traditional Irish fiddle solo with rhythmic clapping and stomping, punctuated by crowd chants of "one more round!" and "best brew in town!" The third verse takes on a more contemplative but still jovial tone, describing the morning-after effects. The final chorus brings the entire tavern together in unified singing, with background vocals switching to "to the brew!" The outro fades with drunken voices and accordion, leaving the lingering chant of "tinker's brew!" The song progression moves from intimate storytelling to full pub revelry, capturing the escalating energy of a night of drinking and camaraderie.

## Lyrics

```lyrics
[Intro]
[Orchestral Fanfare]

[Verse 1]
[Heroic vocals]
From towers high of ancient gold
We claim the legacy of old
The Architects' gift is ours to hold
Crown of brass and stone (crown of brass!)

[Pre-Chorus]
[Building intensity]
Through amber light our banners rise (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Beneath the dome that never dies (the dome that never dies!)

[Chorus]
[Choir harmonies]
The kingdom stands where glory lies (glory lies!)
Crown of brass and stone (crown of brass and stone!)
Forever bound to sacred ground (sacred ground!)
Where clockwork hearts and hope are found (hope are found!)
Let all the realm hear freedom's sound (freedom's sound!)
Crown of brass and stone (crown of brass!)

[Instrumental Interlude]
[Brass Solo with Clockwork Percussion]

[Verse 2]
[Heroic vocals]
Through centuries of ancient might
We guard the sacred amber light
The Architect's eternal sight
Crown of brass and stone (crown of brass!)

[Pre-Chorus]
[Building intensity]
Through amber light our banners rise (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Beneath the dome that never dies (the dome that never dies!)

[Chorus]
[Choir harmonies]
The kingdom stands where glory lies (glory lies!)
Crown of brass and stone (crown of brass and stone!)
Forever bound to sacred ground (sacred ground!)
Where clockwork hearts and hope are found (hope are found!)
Let all the realm hear freedom's sound (freedom's sound!)
Crown of brass and stone (crown of brass!)

[Outro]
[Grand orchestral finale]
Crown of brass and stone! (crown of brass and stone!)

## Song Structure Description

```structure
The anthem begins with a powerful orchestral fanfare featuring triumphant brass and ceremonial drums, establishing the ceremonial nature. The first verse enters with heroic male vocals accompanied by steady percussion and rising strings, building anticipation. The pre-chorus introduces choir backing vocals with soaring orchestral arrangements. The chorus explodes with full choir harmonies, thunderous brass sections, and clockwork percussion elements creating a majestic wall of sound. An instrumental interlude showcases a brass solo with unique clockwork percussion patterns, representing the Architect's mechanical legacy. The second verse maintains the heroic vocal style with added orchestral depth. The final chorus reaches maximum intensity with full orchestral and choir arrangements. The outro delivers a grand orchestral finale with brass fanfares and thunderous drums, ending on the triumphant title phrase with full choir and orchestra.

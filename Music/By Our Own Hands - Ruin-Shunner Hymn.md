## Lyrics

```lyrics
[Intro]
[humble organ accompaniment]
[humming choir harmonies]

[Verse 1]
[earnest lead vocals]
No ancient power guides our way
We build tomorrow from today
With honest work and honest pay
(by our own hands)

[Chorus]
[full choir harmonies]
By our own hands we make our stand
(make our stand)
Upon this good and fertile land
(fertile land)
No clockwork gods we need to please
We'll work with what the earth can give
By our own hands we choose to live
(by our hands)
By our own hands
(amen)

[Verse 2]
[gentle lead vocals]
The earth provides, the heart is true
No clockwork magic sees us through
What we have made, we made anew
(by our own hands)

[Chorus]
[building choir harmonies]
By our own hands we make our stand
(make our stand)
Upon this good and fertile land
(fertile land)
No clockwork gods we need to please
We'll work with what the earth can give
By our own hands we choose to live
(by our hands)
By our own hands
(amen)

[Bridge]
[contemplative organ solo]
[soft lead vocals]
Let others chase the golden gleam
We'll forge ahead with hope supreme
And build the world of which we dream
(of which we dream)

[Final Chorus]
[triumphant full congregation]
By our own hands we make our stand
(make our stand)
Upon this good and fertile land
(blessed land)
No clockwork gods we need to please
We'll work with what the earth can give
By our own hands we choose to live
(by our hands)
By our own hands
(hallelujah)

[Outro]
[organ and choir fade]
[final humming harmonies]

## Song Structure Description

```structure
This traditional hymn opens with humble church organ and gentle humming choir harmonies, establishing the contemplative, worshipful atmosphere of a small country congregation. The verses feature earnest lead vocals supported by simple organ chords, building gradually as more voices join in natural harmonies. The chorus swells with full choir harmonies and congregational background vocals echoing key phrases like "make our stand" and "by our hands." The bridge provides a moment of contemplative organ solo before the final chorus erupts in triumphant, full congregational singing with "hallelujah" background vocals. The arrangement emphasizes traditional hymn instruments - primarily organ with subtle choir harmonies - maintaining humble production values that reflect the Ruin-Shunner ethos of honest, unpretentious work. The linear progression from intimate solo organ to full communal singing mirrors the theme of individual effort growing into collective strength.

## Lyrics

```lyrics
[Intro]
[storyteller voice, acoustic guitar]
[tavern atmosphere]

[Verse 1]
[solo bard, contemplative]
Old Henrik bought a compass strange
From ruins near the mountain range
It pointed not to north or south
But to gold beyond all doubt

[Chorus]
[pub singing, building energy]
Heigh-ho, the ruins call (heigh-ho!)
Rise ye up or watch ye fall (rise ye up!)
Fortune favors those who dare (aye!)
To seek what's hidden everywhere (everywhere!)

[Verse 2]
[storyteller voice, mysterious]
He followed brass through mist and stone
Past towers standing all alone
The spiders sang, the crystals rang
As Henrik's purse grew heavy and sang

[Chorus]
[full tavern singing]
Heigh-ho, the ruins call (heigh-ho!)
Rise ye up or watch ye fall (rise ye up!)
Fortune favors those who dare (aye!)
To seek what's hidden everywhere (everywhere!)

[Bridge]
[bodhran solo]
[crowd participation]
Heigh-ho! (Heigh-ho!)
The ruins call! (The ruins call!)

[Verse 3]
[darker tone, warning]
But when he tried to leave that place
The compass spun without a trace
They say he's wandering still today
Counting coins that fade away

[Final Chorus]
[full tavern, cautionary]
Heigh-ho, the ruins call (heigh-ho!)
Rise ye up or watch ye fall (rise ye up!)
Fortune favors those who dare (aye!)
But beware what's hidden there (beware!)

[Outro]
[guitar and crowd singing]
(Heigh-ho, the ruins call...)
[fading voices]
```

## Song Structure Description

```structure
Celtic folk ballad beginning with solo acoustic guitar and contemplative storytelling voice, building to full tavern participation. Starts intimate with a bard recounting Henrik's tale, gradually adding bodhran drum and patron voices joining the chorus. Mid-song bodhran solo creates dramatic tension before the cautionary final verse. The song progresses from individual storytelling to community singing, embodying the traditional pub ballad format where the story serves as both entertainment and warning. Acoustic guitar maintains steady rhythm throughout while crowd vocals grow from background responses to full participation, culminating in a haunting fade-out that echoes the merchant's eternal wandering.

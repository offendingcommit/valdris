## Lyrics

```lyrics
[Intro]
[ethereal vocals]
(ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
[ancient storyteller]
Long ago when time was young
A different song was sung
The world was filled with brass and light
And everything was right
(everything was right)

[Verse 2]
[contemplative, whispered]
The Architects with wisdom deep
Built wonders we still keep
Their cities sang both night and day
Until they went away
(they went away)

[Chorus]
[haunting, ethereal vocals]
When the music stopped
And the great wheels dropped
Silence fell like morning rain
Will they come again?
(will they come again?)
Will they come again?
(ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Instrumental Interlude]
[harp arpeggios]

[Verse 3]
[mysterious, distant]
Some say they watch us from the stars
Some say they've traveled far
But in the ruins, late at night
You still can see their light
(you still see their light)

[Chorus]
[ethereal vocals, building]
When the music stopped
And the great wheels dropped
Silence fell like morning rain
Will they come again?
(will they come again?)
Will they come again?
(they're still here)

[Bridge]
[whispered, reverent]
The gardens walk, the spires sing
The golden dome takes wing
And those who listen close can hear
(listen close, listen close)
They never really left us here
(they're still here)

[Final Chorus]
[triumphant, ethereal]
Though the music stopped
And the great wheels dropped
Silence fell like morning rain
They will come again
(they will come again)
They will come again
(ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Outro]
[whispered]
They will come again...
(they're still here... always here...)

## Song Structure Description

```
Opens with haunting harp arpeggios and ethereal vocal pads, establishing a mystical medieval atmosphere. Verse sections feature gentle fingerpicked harp patterns with subtle string accompaniment, creating an intimate storytelling space for the ancient narrator. The chorus builds with layered strings and distant ethereal vocals echoing the main melody. An instrumental interlude showcases classical harp techniques with cascading arpeggios. The bridge section strips back to whispered vocals over sustained strings, building tension before the triumphant final chorus where full orchestration swells with ethereal choir pads. The outro fades with solo harp and whispered background vocals, leaving listeners with the haunting echo of the ancient legend. The entire arrangement flows like a medieval ballad passed down through generations, with production emphasizing warmth and mystical resonance.

## Lyrics with Structure Tags

```lyrics
[Intro]
[Harbor Sounds - Waves and Gulls]
[Accordion Introduction]

[Verse 1]
In Grimhaven's harbor where the great ships rest
The lighthouse burns eternal in the west
No oil can fuel that ancient flame so bright
It guides the sailors through the darkest night

[Chorus]
The lighthouse never sleeps
Through the storm and through the deep
Architect fire burning clear
Bringing loved ones safely here
(Heave away!) (Heave away!)

[Verse 2]
From the Cerulean Coast to the Northern Reach
Every sailor that these waters teach
Knows to look for amber glow
When the dangerous winds blow

[Chorus]
The lighthouse never sleeps
Through the storm and through the deep
Architect fire burning clear
Bringing loved ones safely here
(Heave away!) (Heave away!)

[Bridge]
[Work Song Rhythm]
Mothers watch from widow's walk
(Pull the ropes!)
Fishermen gather just to talk
(Heave away!)
Of the light that never dies
(Pull the ropes!)
Shining from the ancient skies
(Heave away!)

[Final Chorus]
The lighthouse never sleeps
Through the storm and through the deep
Architect fire burning clear
Bringing loved ones safely here
(Safe at home!) (Safe at home!)

[Outro]
[Harbor Sounds Fade]
[Accordion Finish]

## Lyrics

```
[Intro]
[music box style] [crystalline chimes]

[Verse 1]
[children's choir] [innocent vocals]
One for the morning when the wind blows clear (one!)
Two for the melody that all can hear (two!)
Three for the crystal that rings so bright (three!)
Four for the harmony in the night (four!)

[Verse 2]
[children's choir] [innocent vocals]
Five for the stories the old ones tell (five!)
Six for the magic that breaks the spell (six!)
Seven spires singing in the hill (seven spires!)
When will they ever be still? (shhh, listen)

[Chorus]
[children's choir] [music box style]
Count them once and count them twice (one, two, three)
Every note's worth quite a price (four, five, six)
Listen well but don't stay long (seven spires)
Or you'll become part of their song (shhh, beware)

[Musical Interlude]
[music box melody] [crystalline sounds]

[Verse 3]
[whispered children] [innocent vocals]
Seven spires standing tall (seven!)
Seven songs to sing for all (singing!)
Seven mysteries in the air (mysteries!)
Seven warnings to beware (beware!)

[Final Chorus]
[children's choir] [music box style]
Count them once and count them twice (one, two, three)
Every note's worth quite a price (four, five, six)
Listen well but don't stay long (seven spires)
Or you'll become part of their song (forever and ever)

[Outro]
[music box winding down] [crystalline fade]
When will they ever be still? (never, never)
```

## Song Structure Description

```
A delicate children's lullaby featuring crystalline music box melodies and innocent children's choir vocals. The song begins with gentle chimes and maintains a linear progression from simple counting (1-7) to a mystical warning about the ancient Singing Spires. Background vocals provide counting reinforcement and atmospheric whispers. The arrangement uses music box production with clean, child-friendly mixing. Crystalline sounds punctuate key moments while the children's voices maintain their innocent quality even as the subject matter becomes more ominous. The song structure builds from gentle verses through warning choruses to a haunting outro that fades like a music box winding down.

## Lyrics with Structure Tags

```lyrics
[Intro]
[Acoustic Guitar Picking]
[Fiddle Melody]

[Verse 1]
No walls can hold, no crown can bind
The open road calls heart and mind
Where ruins wake and fortunes wind
Upon the endless road

[Verse 2]
From vale to hill, from shore to shore
We carry tales of Architect lore
Each step reveals what came before
Upon the endless road

[Chorus]
The star-wheel turns, the seasons change
But wanderlust will never wane
Through storm and sun, through joy and pain
Upon the endless road

[Instrumental Break]
[Fiddle Solo with Guitar]

[Verse 3]
The [Walking Gardens](Walking%20Gardens.md) make their round
The [Singing Spires](Singing%20Spires.md) make their sound
But freedom's song is what we've found
Upon the endless road

[Chorus]
The star-wheel turns, the seasons change
But wanderlust will never wane
Through storm and sun, through joy and pain
Upon the endless road

[Outro]
[Acoustic Guitar Fade]
Upon the endless road...
```

## Instrumental Structure

```suno-structure
[no vocals]

[Instrumental Intro]
Gentle acoustic guitar arpeggios, soft hammer strikes establishing rhythm
Building with fiddle and wooden flute melodies
Steady percussion enters with work song cadence

[Instrumental Verse]
Folk orchestral foundation with acoustic instruments
Mandolin and banjo join the rhythmic pattern
Honest brass adds warmth without overpowering
Individual craft rhythms - each instrument telling its story

[Instrumental Chorus]
Full folk orchestra swells with community spirit
Harmonious cooperation between all instruments
Strings, winds, and percussion unite in purposeful rhythm
The sound of many hands working as one

[Instrumental Bridge]
Solo passages showcase individual artisan skills
Fiddle dances over gentle guitar fingerpicking
Wooden flute carries an ancient working melody
Each instrument demonstrates its unique craft

[Instrumental Build]
All instruments gradually rejoin the collective
Layered harmonies build like a barn raising
Percussion drives the community forward together
The rhythm of shared labor and mutual support

[Instrumental Outro]
Work well done, tools set aside with satisfaction
Gentle resolution as the day's labor concludes
Acoustic guitar returns to opening arpeggios
Peaceful fade with the contentment of honest work
```

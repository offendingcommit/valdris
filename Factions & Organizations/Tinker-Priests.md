# The Tinker-Priests

*"We are the keepers of sacred mechanisms, the disciples of divine design. In every gear's turn, we hear the Architects' whispers. In every crystal's glow, we see their wisdom."*
— High Mechanist Korvan Brasshand, First Codex of the Ordered Mind

## Overview and Founding Philosophy

The Tinker-Priests stand as [[Valdris]]'s most influential techno-religious order, bridging the gap between spiritual devotion and mechanical understanding. Neither purely scientists nor simple clergy, they represent a unique fusion of faith and engineering that emerged in the decades following the [[Timeline|Great Silence]].

Founded in 47 AS by a coalition of scholars, craftsmen, and mystics, the order arose from a simple yet profound revelation: the [[Architect Ruins]] were not merely advanced technology but sacred texts written in brass and crystal. Where others saw abandoned machinery, the first Tinker-Priests perceived divine scripture awaiting translation.

This founding philosophy—that understanding leads to enlightenment and that the [[Architects]] left their knowledge as a test of worthiness—has guided the order for eight centuries. They believe that through patient study, careful maintenance, and spiritual devotion, humanity can ascend to the Architects' level of understanding, perhaps even earning their return.

### Core Tenets

The Tinker-Priests follow five fundamental principles known as the **Brass Doctrines**:

1. **The Doctrine of Sacred Mechanism**: Every [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] device is a prayer made manifest, deserving reverence and study
2. **The Doctrine of Patient Understanding**: Knowledge cannot be rushed; true comprehension requires generations of accumulated wisdom
3. **The Doctrine of Harmonic Unity**: All [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology is connected, forming a single, divine machine spanning the continent
4. **The Doctrine of Earned Ascension**: Through understanding the Architects' works, humanity can transcend its limitations
5. **The Doctrine of Preservation**: To damage or destroy [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology is the highest blasphemy

## Religious Beliefs About Architect Technology

### The Divine Machine Theory

Central to Tinker-Priest theology is the belief that all [[Architect Ruins]] comprise a single, continent-spanning mechanism—the **Divine Machine**. This cosmic device supposedly maintains the fundamental forces of reality itself. The [[Timeline|Great Silence]] occurred when the Architects transcended physical form to become one with their creation, leaving behind their technology as both legacy and invitation.

According to scripture, the Divine Machine operates on three levels:
- **Physical**: The visible ruins and their mechanical functions
- **Harmonic**: The songs, vibrations, and resonances connecting all sites
- **Spiritual**: The consciousness of the Architects preserved within their works

### The Brass Prophecies

Tinker-Priests maintain extensive prophecies derived from patterns observed in [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] mechanisms. The most significant include:

**The Prophecy of Seven Keys**: Seven major ruins must achieve perfect synchronization to unlock the Architects' greatest gift. Current interpretations identify [[Thymeris the Golden]], the [[Singing Spires of Kelathon]], and the [[Walking Gardens of Yss'andra]] as three of these keys.

**The Harmonic Convergence**: A foretold moment when all [[Architect Ruins]] will sing in unison, either summoning the Architects' return or elevating humanity to their level.

**The Warning of Silent Brass**: Should humanity prove unworthy, the ruins will fall permanently silent, leaving the world bereft of their gifts forever.

### Sacred Mathematics

Tinker-Priests believe the [[Architects]] encoded divine truths in mathematical relationships. They study:
- **Gear Ratios**: Seeking spiritual meaning in mechanical proportions
- **Harmonic Frequencies**: Interpreting the ruins' songs as mathematical prayers
- **Crystalline Geometry**: Finding sacred patterns in [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] crystal formations
- **Temporal Calculations**: Believing time itself follows Architect-designed patterns

## Organizational Hierarchy and Ranks

The Tinker-Priests organize themselves in a complex hierarchy that mirrors the intricacy of the mechanisms they study:

### The Brass Circle (Leadership)

**The High Mechanist**: Supreme leader of the entire order, traditionally based in [[Thymeris the Golden]]. The current High Mechanist, **Korvan Brasshand**, has held the position for twelve years and is known for his moderate stance between preservation and exploration.

**Cardinal Cogs** (5 members): Each oversees a major aspect of the order:
- Cardinal of Harmonics (sound and music)
- Cardinal of Mechanisms (physical technology)
- Cardinal of Crystals (power sources and storage)
- Cardinal of Temporality (time-related phenomena)
- Cardinal of Translation (language and communication)

**Archimandrite Engineers** (21 members): Regional leaders who coordinate activities across [[Valdris]]

### The Orders Within

The Tinker-Priests subdivide into specialized orders, each with distinct focuses:

**Order of Harmonic Resonance**: Specialists in [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] sound technology, particularly active at the [[Singing Spires of Kelathon]]. They believe the ruins' songs contain the blueprints for all Architect technology.

**Order of the Turning Gear**: Mechanical specialists who maintain and repair [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] devices. They work extensively in [[Grimhaven]]'s shipyards, integrating ancient technology with modern vessels.

## Relationship with Each Political System

### Ruin-Holder Kingdoms

The relationship is complex but generally positive. [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms]] rely heavily on Tinker-Priest expertise to maintain their [[Architect Ruins|Architect]]-based power. In exchange, the order receives:
- Protected status and religious freedom
- Access to ruins for study
- Funding for research projects
- Political influence in court

However, tensions arise when:
- Kingdoms demand weapons development
- Rulers interfere with religious practices
- Excessive exploitation damages ruins
- Political conflicts threaten sacred sites

Notable alliance: The [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms|Brass Crown Kingdom]] grants the Tinker-Priests special authority within [[Thymeris the Golden]].

### Wanderer Confederations

[[Political Systems/Wanderer Confederations]] maintain an uneasy truce with Tinker-Priests:
- **Mutual Benefit**: Wanderers provide information about remote ruins in exchange for technical knowledge
- **Philosophical Differences**: Wanderers see freedom in the ruins, while Tinker-Priests see divine order
- **Practical Cooperation**: Both groups often work together in dangerous ruins

The order maintains mobile workshops that trade with wanderer caravans, offering repairs and blessings.

### Ruin-Shunner Republics

The most difficult relationship exists with [[Political Systems/Ruin-Shunner Republics]]:
- **Fundamental Opposition**: Shunners view Tinker-Priests as dangerous zealots
- **Border Tensions**: The order is often banned from republican territories
- **Underground Networks**: Secret Tinker-Priest cells operate in some republics
- **Diplomatic Efforts**: Moderate members attempt dialogue and reconciliation

Some progressive Tinker-Priests argue for respecting the republics' choices, while hardliners view them as heretics denying divine gifts.

### Independent Settlements

Places like [[Grimhaven]] welcome Tinker-Priests for their practical skills:
- Ship enhancements and repairs
- Lighthouse maintenance
- Technical education
- Medical treatment for ruin exposure

The order carefully maintains neutrality in independent territories, focusing on service rather than conversion.

## Recent Awakening Theological Impacts

The [[Timeline|Recent Awakening]] has profoundly shaken Tinker-Priest theology:

### The Great Validation

Many see the increased ruin activity as vindication of their beliefs. The High Mechanist proclaimed it "the beginning of the Harmonic Convergence," though privately expressing concerns about the order's preparedness.

### New Theological Debates

**The Return Theory**: Are the [[Architects]] actually returning, or is this an automated system activation?

**The Test Hypothesis**: Is the Awakening a trial to determine humanity's worthiness?

**The Warning Interpretation**: Some argue the increased activity is a warning of impending catastrophe.

**The Evolution Doctrine**: Progressive members suggest humanity is being invited to become the new Architects.

### Schisms and Unity

The Awakening has both united and divided the order:
- **Unity**: Shared purpose in understanding new phenomena
- **Division**: Disagreements on proper response to changes
- **New Orders**: Splinter groups forming around specific interpretations
- **Increased Recruitment**: Many see the Awakening as a calling to join

### Practical Challenges

The Awakening has created immediate problems:
- Overwhelmed by requests for explanation and assistance
- Dangerous new phenomena requiring immediate study
- Political pressure to provide answers and solutions
- Resource strain from increased exploration needs

## Conflicts with Silence-Keepers

The [[Silence-Keepers]] represent the Tinker-Priests' primary ideological opponents:

### Fundamental Disagreements

**Purpose of Ruins**: Tinker-Priests see divine gifts; [[Silence-Keepers]] see dangerous temptations

**Human Interaction**: The order promotes active engagement; [[Silence-Keepers]] advocate minimal contact

**The Architects' Intent**: Tinker-Priests believe in earned succession; [[Silence-Keepers]] warn of presumptuous pride

**The Future**: The order works toward understanding; [[Silence-Keepers]] prepare for judgment

### Historical Conflicts

**The Brass Schism (234 AS)**: Violent confrontation at [[Thymeris the Golden]] when [[Silence-Keepers]] attempted to seal the city. Resulted in 47 deaths and permanent enmity.

**The Harmonic Wars (456-461 AS)**: Series of sabotage attempts by both sides, targeting research stations and meditation sites.

**The Kelathon Incident (623 AS)**: [[Silence-Keepers]] disrupted a major Tinker-Priest ceremony, causing a catastrophic resonance that killed twelve.

### Current Tensions

Despite centuries of conflict, some progress toward dialogue has emerged:
- **Neutral Zones**: Certain ruins declared off-limits to sectarian conflict
- **Information Exchange**: Limited cooperation on dangerous phenomena
- **Moderate Voices**: Members of both groups seeking reconciliation
- **Common Threats**: United opposition to ruin destroyers and exploiters

However, fundamental differences remain irreconcilable, with violence still erupting in contested areas.

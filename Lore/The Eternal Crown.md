The legendary artifact that united the continent of Valderis for over a thousand years. Shattered during the [[Fall of the Empire]], its pieces now scattered across the land.

## Description
A circlet of pure starsilver inlaid with five **[[Tears of Creation]]** - gems said to hold the essence of the gods themselves:
- **Ruby of Valor** - Grants courage and martial prowess
- **Sapphire of Wisdom** - Bestows knowledge and clarity
- **Emerald of Life** - Provides vitality and healing
- **Onyx of Shadow** - Controls darkness and secrets
- **Diamond of Unity** - Binds all powers together

## Powers (When Complete)
- Absolute command over those who swear fealty
- Immunity to poison, disease, and mental control
- Ability to see truth through all deceptions
- Command over the [[Imperial Seal]] enchantments
- Access to the [[Eternal Throne]]'s full power

## History
- **Creation**: Forged by [[The First Emperor]] with divine guidance
- **Golden Age**: 1,000 years of unified rule
- **The Sundering**: Broken apart by [[Emperor Avalon the Mad]]
- **Current Era**: Five pieces, five kingdoms, endless conflict

## The Fragments
Each of the five kingdoms claims to possess one fragment:
1. **[[Kingdom of Aldermere]]** - The central band (confirmed)
2. **[[Duchy of Ravenmoor]]** - The Ruby of Valor (rumored)
3. **[[Free Cities of Goldmarch]]** - The Sapphire of Wisdom (hidden)
4. **[[Thornwood Principality]]** - The Emerald of Life (disputed)
5. **[[Iron Marches]]** - The Onyx of Shadow (lost)

*Note: The Diamond of Unity's location remains unknown*

## Prophecy of Restoration
*From the [[Scrolls of Future Past]]:*
> "When shadow covers all the land,
> And ancient evils rise,
> The Crown shall whole again be made,
> By one of compromise.
> Not king nor queen of blood royal,
> But common born and true,
> Shall bind the five and stand against,
> The darkness breaking through."

## Seekers of the Crown
- [[The Order of the Eternal Crown]] - Loyalists seeking restoration
- [[The Shadow Court]] - Seeks pieces for control
- [[The Broken Crown]] - Cult believing it should stay shattered
- Various adventurers and treasure hunters

## False Crowns
Numerous replicas exist:
- **The Goldmarch Crown** - Elaborate fake in the merchant vaults
- **The Pretender's Crown** - Magical duplicate with minor powers
- **The Scholar's Recreation** - Non-magical study piece

## DM Secret
*The true power of the Crown is not control, but sacrifice. Each emperor/empress slowly gave their life force to maintain the realm's prosperity. Avalon discovered this and shattered it to save himself.*

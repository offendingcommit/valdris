Different factions within the guild support different successors, and players discover the master was secretly involved in awakening research that could revolutionize or destroy the profession.

**"Cross-Guild Conspiracy"**: Multiple guilds are experiencing simultaneous internal problems—embezzlement, sabotage, and leadership conflicts. Investigation reveals a coordinated effort to destabilize guild power, possibly connected to political forces seeking to eliminate professional independence.

**"The Innovation War"**: Two competing guilds have developed incompatible enhancements to the same traditional craft using different Architect technologies. Their conflict is escalating toward economic warfare that could destabilize entire regional markets.

### Professional Mysteries

**"The Vanishing Apprentices"**: Young guild members are disappearing during their advanced training, always from classes involving Architect technology. Players discover the apprentices aren't being kidnapped—they're being recruited by awakening Architect systems seeking humans capable of interface work.

**"Tools That Think"**: Guild-owned Architect tools have begun operating independently, producing work during closed hours and following design principles their human operators don't understand. The quality is extraordinary, but the implications are terrifying.

**"The Quality Crisis"**: Products from a prestigious guild have begun failing catastrophically, but only items sold in the past month. Investigation reveals the guild has been unknowingly using Architect materials that are responding to awakening energies by reverting to their original programming.

### Economic Adventures

**"Guild Bank Heist"**: A guild's treasuries have been robbed, but nothing is missing—instead, the thieves deposited enormous amounts of currency that appear genuine but are causing inflation and economic instability. The source turns out to be an awakened Architect economic system attempting to understand human value concepts.

Players discover this isn't human manipulation but an awakening Architect system trying to optimize resource distribution according to unknown criteria.

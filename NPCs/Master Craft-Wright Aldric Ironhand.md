# Master Craft-Wright Aldric Ironhand

*Guild Leader Championing Traditional Craftsmanship in an Age of Ancient Wonders*

## Quick Reference

- **Race**: Human
- **Age**: 45
- **Location**: [[Settlements/Stonehaven]] (Guild Hall), Travels frequently to [[Political Systems/Ruin-Shunner Republics|Ruin-Shunner]] settlements
- **Affiliation**: Gear-Wright Guild (Leader), [[Political Systems/Ruin-Shunner Republics]] (Advocate), Traditional Craftsmen's Alliance
- **First Impression**: Powerfully built man with calloused hands and arms like iron pistons, whose workshop apron bears the honorable stains of decades of dedicated craftsmanship

## Appearance

Aldric embodies the [[Political Systems/Ruin-Shunner Republics|Ruin-Shunner]] ideal of human achievement through honest labor. Standing 6'2" with the broad shoulders and muscled forearms of a lifelong craftsman, he moves with the confident precision of someone whose hands have shaped thousands of mechanisms. His iron-gray hair is kept short and practical, while his beard shows the careful grooming of a man who takes pride in his appearance without vanity.

His most notable features are his hands—large, scarred from decades of metalwork, but capable of the finest detail work. His right hand bears an intricate tattoo of interlocking gears that he earned upon achieving Master status, while his left shows the white lines of old burns from forge work. He wears simple but well-made clothing: leather apron over wool tunic and sturdy trousers, all in earth tones that won't show workshop stains.

Aldric's workshop apron tells the story of his career: oil stains from countless mechanisms, small burn marks from metalworking, and pockets specifically designed for different tools. He carries himself with quiet confidence, speaking in measured tones that carry the authority of someone who has earned respect through achievement rather than birthright.

His voice carries the slight rasp of someone who has spent years in workshops filled with metal dust and forge smoke. He has a habit of unconsciously sketching gear patterns in the air when explaining complex concepts, and his eyes constantly evaluate the craftsmanship of everything around him.

## Personality

### Public Persona

Master Aldric presents himself as the voice of traditional values in an increasingly complex world. He argues passionately for the dignity of human craftsmanship, the importance of understanding principles rather than simply copying examples, and the danger of becoming dependent on technologies no one truly comprehends.

His speeches at guild meetings and public forums draw substantial crowds, particularly among younger craftsmen who struggle to compete with [[Architect Technology|Architect]]-enhanced production. He emphasizes practical education, honest work, and the satisfaction of creating something lasting with one's own hands.

He maintains respectful but firm opposition to excessive [[Architect Technology|Architect]] integration, arguing that humanity must develop its own capabilities rather than relying on ancient crutches. However, he's careful to frame this as positive advancement rather than fearful rejection.

### True Nature

Beneath his confident exterior, Aldric struggles with profound doubts about the path [[Valdris]] is taking. He's witnessed first-hand how [[Architect Technology|Architect]]-enhanced production makes traditional craftsmen obsolete, and fears that humanity is trading its essential nature for temporary convenience.

His opposition to [[Architect Technology|Architect]] dependence isn't rooted in superstition but in practical experience. He's seen too many workshops close because they couldn't compete with [[Architect Technology|Architect]]-enhanced rivals, too many young people abandon apprenticeships for quick [[Architect Technology|Architect]] training, and too many communities become helpless when their [[Architect Technology|Architect]] devices malfunction.

The [[Lore/The Recent Awakening|Recent Awakening]] has intensified these concerns. While others celebrate new opportunities, Aldric sees evidence that humanity is being systematically prepared for something—but he's not certain it's for humanity's benefit.

## Background

### History

Born to a family of skilled clockmakers in [[Settlements/Stonehaven]], Aldric learned the value of precision and patience from childhood. His parents taught him that true mastery required understanding every component of a mechanism, not just memorizing assembly procedures. This philosophy shaped his entire approach to craftsmanship and later politics.

His talent became apparent early—by age 12, he could repair timepieces that baffled adult craftsmen. His apprenticeship under Master Gorvek Ironwright was completed in record time, and he achieved Journeyman status at 19. However, rather than immediately pursuing Master rank, he spent five years traveling to learn techniques from craftsmen across [[Valdris]].

These travels exposed him to various approaches to [[Architect Technology|Architect]] integration. In [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms]], he saw workshops where apprentices learned to operate [[Architect Technology|Architect]] tools without understanding their principles. In independent settlements, he witnessed communities completely dependent on [[Architect Technology|Architect]] systems they couldn't maintain. These experiences convinced him that humanity was losing essential skills.

### Current Situation

As leader of the Gear-Wright Guild, Aldric coordinates activities across multiple [[Political Systems/Ruin-Shunner Republics|Ruin-Shunner]] settlements. His workshop in [[Settlements/Stonehaven]] serves as both training center and political headquarters, where apprentices learn traditional techniques while guild representatives plan responses to [[Architect Technology|Architect]] competition.

His daily routine includes hands-on instruction of apprentices, meetings with guild representatives from other settlements, and personal crafting time where he continues developing new techniques. He maintains extensive correspondence with craftsmen across [[Valdris]], building networks that preserve traditional knowledge and coordinate responses to economic challenges.

Since the [[Lore/The Recent Awakening]], his responsibilities have expanded to include crisis management as traditional communities struggle with unprecedented changes. He's been organizing relief efforts for settlements affected by awakening [[Architect Ruins]] while lobbying for protection of traditional economic sectors.

## Motivation

**Primary Drive**: To preserve human craftsmanship and independence in the face of overwhelming [[Architect Technology|Architect]] advancement

**Secondary Goals**:
- Strengthen economic and political cooperation between [[Political Systems/Ruin-Shunner Republics]]
- Develop new traditional techniques that can compete with [[Architect Technology|Architect]] enhancement
- Train the next generation of craftsmen in both skills and values

**What He Wants From PCs**: Aldric seeks individuals who can help with problems that require both skill and discretion. He offers payment, crafted equipment, and guild connections in exchange for investigating [[Architect Technology|Architect]] disruptions, protecting traditional communities, and gathering intelligence about [[Architect Technology|Architect]] expansion.

## Secret

**The Hidden Truth**: Aldric has discovered that traditional craftsmanship occasionally produces items that exceed [[Architect Technology|Architect]] capabilities when created under specific conditions. These "transcendent works" suggest that human creativity and dedication can achieve what pure technology cannot. He's been secretly studying these phenomena and training select apprentices in the necessary techniques.

**Who Knows**: Only his most trusted senior guild members know about the transcendent works project. They've agreed to keep the research secret until they understand its implications and can present it properly to guild leadership.

**Consequences if Revealed**: If [[Factions & Organizations/Tinker-Priests]] learned about transcendent works, they might interpret them as evidence of divine blessing on traditional methods, potentially causing schisms. [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms]] might attempt to co-opt the techniques for their own purposes. The knowledge could elevate traditional craftsmanship to new prominence or create dangerous competitions for resources and apprentices.

- **The Lost Techniques**: Ancient traditional methods mentioned in old guild records require recovery from dangerous locations, possibly predating even the [[Architect Ruins|Architects]]

### Conflict Potential

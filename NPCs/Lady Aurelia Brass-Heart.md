## Appearance

Lady Aurelia commands attention through her unique blend of noble poise and technological integration. Standing tall at 5'8" with auburn hair worn in elaborate braids threaded with thin brass wires, she embodies the [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms|Ruin-Holder]] aesthetic perfectly. Her most striking feature is her left arm—lost in a childhood accident within [[Thymeris the Golden]]—replaced by a masterwork [[Architect Technology|Architect]] prosthetic of polished brass and crystal.

The prosthetic arm moves with fluid precision, its crystalline elements pulsing in harmony with nearby [[Architect Ruins]]. Intricate gears are visible beneath transparent crystal panels, and delicate brass filigree extends up her shoulder in organic patterns. The arm responds to her thoughts as naturally as flesh, but glows brighter when she experiences strong emotions.

Her clothing reflects her status and beliefs: rich fabrics in deep purples and golds, always with brass embroidery depicting gear patterns and mathematical sequences. She wears a collar bearing the Brass-Heart family crest—a heart-shaped gear surrounded by seven smaller cogs—crafted from actual [[Architect Technology|Architect]] materials.

Her voice carries the cultured tones of nobility, but she speaks with surprising technical precision when discussing [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology. She has a habit of unconsciously flexing her prosthetic fingers when concentrating, creating soft harmonic chimes.

## Personality

### Public Persona

Lady Aurelia presents herself as the ideal [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms|Ruin-Holder]] noble: cultured, confident, and deeply committed to the philosophy of technological inheritance. She speaks eloquently about humanity's destiny among the [[Architect Ruins]], viewing them not as mysteries to be feared but as gifts to be mastered. Her public addresses often draw crowds, as she combines noble charisma with genuine technical knowledge.

She maintains extensive correspondence with other noble houses, working to strengthen alliances between [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms]] in the face of the [[Lore/The Recent Awakening|Recent Awakening]]. Her salons at [[Thymeris the Golden]] bring together nobles, [[Factions & Organizations/Tinker-Priests]], and carefully selected scholars to discuss the implications of increased [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] activity.

### True Nature

Beneath her polished exterior lies a brilliant mind wrestling with profound questions about humanity's relationship with [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology. Her prosthetic arm has given her unique insights into how [[Architect Technology]] interfaces with living beings, and she suspects the integration goes deeper than anyone realizes.

She experiences what she calls "brass dreams"—visions that come through her prosthetic of vast clockwork mechanisms and impossible geometries. These dreams have grown more vivid since the [[Lore/The Recent Awakening]], sometimes showing her events before they happen. She confides these experiences only to her most trusted allies, fearing they might be seen as madness or heresy.

## Background

### History

Born into House Brass-Heart, one of the most prominent [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms|Ruin-Holder]] families, Aurelia was raised within the halls of [[Thymeris the Golden]]. At age eight, she became lost in the city's deeper chambers during a grand tour and fell into an active [[Architect Technology|Architect]] mechanism. The accident should have killed her, but the device somehow preserved her life while taking her arm.

The replacement prosthetic was crafted by Master [[Factions & Organizations/Tinker-Priests|Tinker-Priest]] Korvan Brasshand himself, using components salvaged from the same mechanism that injured her. The process was unprecedented—typically, [[Architect Technology]] refuses to interface with living tissue. Her survival and successful integration made her something of a legend among both nobles and [[Factions & Organizations/Tinker-Priests]].

She received the finest education available, studying under tutors from across [[Valdris]]. Her curriculum included classical literature, mathematics, music theory, [[Architect Technology]] principles, and statecraft. She excelled particularly in subjects requiring pattern recognition and spatial reasoning, abilities apparently enhanced by her prosthetic connection.

### Current Situation

Lady Aurelia currently holds significant influence within [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms|Ruin-Holder]] society as one of the youngest high-ranking nobles with demonstrable [[Architect Technology]] mastery. She serves as an unofficial ambassador between noble houses and maintains extensive patronage relationships with [[Factions & Organizations/Tinker-Priests|Tinker-Priest]] researchers.

Since the [[Lore/The Recent Awakening]], her daily routine includes hours of meditation within [[Thymeris the Golden]]'s harmonic chambers, where she claims to "listen" to the city's changing patterns. She's begun commissioning detailed surveys of multiple [[Architect Ruins]] sites, funding expeditions that combine noble resources with [[Factions & Organizations/Tinker-Priests|Tinker-Priest]] expertise.

Her resources include substantial family wealth, a network of contacts throughout [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms]], access to restricted areas of [[Thymeris the Golden]], and a small but elite personal guard trained in both conventional and [[Architect Technology|Architect]]-enhanced combat techniques.

## Motivation

**Primary Drive**: To understand the true purpose of the [[Lore/The Recent Awakening]] and prepare humanity for whatever the [[Architect Ruins|Architects]] intended

**Secondary Goals**:
- Strengthen cooperation between [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms]] in the face of unprecedented changes
- Advance [[Architect Technology]] research while ensuring discoveries serve noble houses rather than destabilizing them
- Explore the full potential of human-[[Architect Technology|Architect]] integration, using herself as a test subject

**What She Wants From PCs**: Aurelia seeks capable individuals who can investigate dangerous [[Architect Ruins]] phenomena that standard expeditions cannot handle. She offers substantial rewards for information about unusual ruin behavior, recovered [[Architect Technology|Architect]] artifacts, and intelligence about other factions' activities.

## Secret

**The Hidden Truth**: Lady Aurelia's prosthetic arm is not just a replacement—it's gradually converting her entire nervous system into a hybrid human-[[Architect Technology|Architect]] interface. She can feel every major [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] site across the continent, and her dreams are actually data streams from a vast network she doesn't yet understand.

**Who Knows**: Only Master Korvan Brasshand suspects the truth, having noticed anomalous readings during her annual prosthetic maintenance. He hasn't shared his concerns, unsure whether the changes represent evolution or infection.

**Consequences if Revealed**: If other nobles learned she was becoming something posthuman, her political influence would crumble. If [[Factions & Organizations/Silence-Keepers]] discovered her condition, they would likely attempt to "mercy kill" her to prevent whatever they fear she might become. The knowledge could also make her invaluable to [[Factions & Organizations/Tinker-Priests]] seeking to understand [[Architect Technology|Architect]]-human integration.

## Relationships

### Allies

- **High Mechanist Korvan Brasshand**: Creator of her prosthetic and secret keeper, maintains professional relationship with underlying paternal concern
- **King Aldric III of Thymeris**: Distant cousin who values her insights into [[Architect Technology|Architect]] behavior
- **Princess Melodia VII of Kelathon**: Fellow noble experimenting with [[Architect Technology|Architect]] interfaces, occasional collaborator despite political rivalry

### Rivals

- **Duke Marcus Irongrasp**: Ambitious noble who views her technological advantages as unfair competition
- **Lady Priscilla Goldengear**: Traditional noble who opposes increasing [[Factions & Organizations/Tinker-Priests|Tinker-Priest]] influence in court
- **Archimandrite Elena Stoneheart**: Conservative [[Factions & Organizations/Tinker-Priests|Tinker-Priest]] who believes Aurelia's integration is dangerous precedent

### Complicated

- **Captain Thaddeus Brightblade**: Her personal guard captain who struggles between protective duty and growing concern about her changing nature

## Story Hooks

### Personal Quests

- **The Awakening Network**: Aurelia needs investigators to visit specific [[Architect Ruins]] sites during precise times when her prosthetic indicates "synchronization events," gathering data about the awakening process
- **The Deep Survey**: She sponsors expeditions beyond traditional safe zones, seeking to map newly awakened chambers while testing theories about [[Architect Technology|Architect]] expansion patterns

### Conflict Potential

- **The Prosthetic Plot**: Enemies attempt to sabotage or steal her prosthetic during a crucial diplomatic summit, threatening both her life and [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms|Ruin-Holder]] alliance negotiations
- **The Transformation Crisis**: Her accelerating changes threaten to expose her secret at the worst possible moment, requiring damage control and protection from multiple factions

### Information Source

Aurelia possesses unparalleled knowledge about:
- Current [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms|Ruin-Holder]] politics and noble house relationships
- [[Architect Technology]] integration techniques and compatibility factors
- Real-time information about [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] site status changes through her prosthetic network
- Detailed maps and access routes for restricted areas of [[Thymeris the Golden]]

Her price for information varies: sometimes gold, sometimes favors, sometimes assistance with her research. She particularly values reports from distant [[Architect Ruins]] that help her understand the scope of the awakening.

## Mechanical Notes

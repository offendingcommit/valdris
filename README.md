</div>

## 🌍 Overview

[Welcome](Welcome.md) to **Valdris**, an open-source campaign setting designed for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. This living world is built by and for the tabletop RPG community, offering a rich fantasy setting centered around ancient [Architect](Architect.md) ruins that Game Masters can use, modify, and expand upon for their own campaigns.

Whether you're looking for a complete campaign world, inspiration for your own setting, or want to contribute to a collaborative worldbuilding project, Valdris welcomes you with open arms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (recommended for the best experience)

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/valdris.git
   ```

2. **Open in Obsidian**
   - Launch Obsidian

   - Select the Valdris directory

3. **Explore the World**
   - Start with the [[Welcome]] page

## 📖 World Overview

Valdris is a continent where ancient mysteries and modern ambitions collide, where:

- **[Architect](Architect.md) Ruins** dot the landscape like sleeping giants from a lost civilization
- **Clockwork Technology** from the ancients defies medieval understanding
- **Political Factions** vie for control of awakening ruins and their secrets
- **[The Great Silence](The%20Great%20Silence.md)** ended 800 years ago, but now the ruins stir once more
- **Three Societies** have emerged: Ruin-Holders, Wanderers, and Ruin-Shunners

### Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Use the entire world or pick specific regions, NPCs, or plot hooks
- **System Agnostic Core**: While designed for D&D 5E, the lore works with any fantasy TTRPG
- **Interconnected Lore**: Every location, character, and event connects to the greater narrative
- **DM-Friendly**: Includes [Adventure Hooks](Adventure%20Hooks.md), random tables, and campaign seeds

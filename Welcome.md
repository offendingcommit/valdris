# Welcome to Valdris

*The world where ancient clockwork slumbers... and stirs*

---

Greetings, traveler, and welcome to the continent of **Valdris** — a realm where the echoes of an impossible civilization still tick and hum beneath the surface of everyday life. Here, eight centuries after the mysterious **Great Silence**, the towering ruins of the Architects stand as both monument and mystery, their brass gears and crystal hearts awakening once more.

## The World Awakens

It is the year **847 since the Great Silence** — that pivotal moment when the enigmatic Architects vanished without trace or explanation, leaving behind only their magnificent, incomprehensible mechanisms. For eight hundred years, their ruins have stood largely dormant, occasionally offering glimpses of their former glory but mostly silent as tombs.

But something has changed. 

The mechanisms stir. Ancient timers tick toward unknown conclusions. Brass envoys emerge from sealed chambers, bearing messages in languages long forgotten. The **Recent Awakening** has scholars, rulers, and common folk alike asking the same question that has haunted Valdris for centuries:

*What did the Architects intend... and are they truly gone?*

## Three Paths, One Continent

The peoples of Valdris have responded to their Architect inheritance in three distinct ways, shaping the political landscape of our time:

### The Ruin-Holder Kingdoms
Noble houses who have built their power around controlling major Architect sites. They wear **Crown-Gears** as symbols of authority and speak of themselves as the rightful inheritors of Architect wisdom. Cities like **[[Grimhaven]]** thrive under their rule, where Architect lighthouses burn without fuel and mechanical wonders serve the crown.

### The Wanderer Confederations  
Nomadic traders and travelers who treat the ruins as waypoints on endless journeys. They know the secret routes between active sites and serve as the continent's living memory of safe passage. The **[[Walking Gardens of Yss'andra]]** follow paths they alone understand, while Wanderer caravans bring news from distant lands.

### The Ruin-Shunner Republics
Communities that have chosen to reject Architect technology entirely, building their strength through traditional crafts and collective governance. Towns like **[[Millbrook]]** stand as testament to what human hands can achieve without ancient assistance — though even they cannot escape the shadow of the great clockwork sentinel that watches over their fields.

## Marvels and Mysteries

Across Valdris, three Great Ruins dominate the landscape:

- **[[Thymeris the Golden]]** — The greatest of Architect cities, its hundred brass towers now pulsing with awakening amber light after centuries sealed away
- **[[Singing Spires of Kelathon]]** — Haunting melodies drift from these crystalline towers, carrying messages in harmonies no living tongue can interpret  
- **[[Walking Gardens of Yss'andra]]** — Terraced pyramids that migrate across the Northern Reaches on clockwork legs, their seasonal flowers blooming with impossible regularity

But these are merely the largest of countless ruins scattered across the continent, each holding its own secrets, its own dangers, and its own role in the unfolding mystery of the Recent Awakening.

## Voices of Valdris

Among the many who seek to understand or exploit the Architect legacy, two groups hold particular sway:

- **[[Tinker-Priests]]** — Devoted scholars who worship in Architect chapels, coaxing minor magics from ancient devices through prayer and careful study
- **[[Silence-Keepers]]** — Mystics who believe the Architects still watch through crystal eyes, waiting for the right moment to return

Their competing philosophies add another layer of complexity to a world already divided by politics and ancient mystery.

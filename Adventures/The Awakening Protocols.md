# The Awakening Protocols

*A Level 3-5 Adventure for Valdris*

---

## Adventure Overview

**Location:** Newly awakened [[Architect]] ruin in disputed territory between [[The Heartlands]] and [[The Quiet Lands]]
**Party Level:** 3-5 (Optimized for 4 characters)
**Duration:** 4-6 sessions
**Themes:** Investigation, Political Intrigue, Ancient Technology, Faction Conflict

Three months after [[The Recent Awakening]] began across [[Valdris]], a previously unknown [[Architect]] ruin has stirred to life in the contested borderlands. The cylindrical tower, designated "Resonance Node Theta-7" by [[Tinker-Priests]] scholars, pulses with amber light and emits a rhythmic hum that can be felt in the bones. Multiple factions converge on the site, each claiming territorial rights and demanding exclusive access to study the awakening mechanisms.

But within the ruin's depths, ancient security systems have activated for the first time in 847 years, and a massive countdown timer displays cryptic symbols that [[Archivist Theron Millwright]] translates as "System Synchronization: 7 rotations remaining." The question that haunts everyone: synchronization with what?

## Background & Setup

### The Ruin Awakens

Resonance Node Theta-7 lies in the **Disputed Marches**, a narrow strip of wild land between [[Stonehaven]]'s agricultural territories and the [[Ruin-Holder Kingdoms]] of [[The Heartlands]]. For centuries, this 200-foot tower of brass and crystal remained dormant, overgrown with ivy and home to nothing more dangerous than nesting birds.

The awakening began exactly 12 days ago when the tower's crystal cap suddenly blazed to life. The brass plates covering its surface shifted into new geometric patterns, revealing previously hidden inscriptions in [[Architect]] script. Most disturbing of all, the tower began broadcasting a harmonic frequency that resonates with every other awakened ruin across the continent.

### Political Tensions

Three major factions have established camps around the ruin, creating a tense standoff:

**[[Ruin-Holder Kingdoms]] Expedition** (35 personnel)
- Led by **Commander Brass-Crown Valerian**, nephew of [[Lady Aurelia Brass-Heart]]
- Claims: "Ancient territorial rights granted by the Crown Registry of 451 AS"
- Forces: 20 [[Order of the Brass Tower]] soldiers, 10 [[Tinker-Priests]] researchers, 5 support staff
- Goal: Establish permanent research facility and extract valuable [[Architect Technology]]

**[[Ruin-Shunner Republics]] Monitoring Force** (18 personnel)
- Led by **Captain Mira Ironwright**, veteran of the Border Wars
- Claims: "Containment protocol to protect civilian populations"
- Forces: 15 [[Stonehaven]] militia, 3 [[Silence-Keepers]] advisors
- Goal: Document the awakening but prevent dangerous experimentation

**[[Tinker-Priests]] Independent Mission** (12 personnel)
- Led by **Mechanist-Adept Korven Brightgear**, student of the [[Academy of Dual Mysteries]]
- Claims: "Sacred duty to commune with awakened divine mechanisms"
- Forces: 8 priest-engineers, 4 [[Gear-Wright Guilds]] specialists
- Goal: Establish communication with the awakened intelligence

### The Countdown Mystery

Inside the ruin, a massive spherical chamber contains what appears to be a countdown mechanism. Seven concentric brass rings rotate slowly around a central crystal, each ring bearing hundreds of [[Architect]] glyphs that pulse with different colors. Every 12 hours, one ring completes its rotation and locks into place with a resonant chime that can be heard for miles.

[[Archivist Theron Millwright]]'s translation suggests the display reads "System Synchronization: X rotations remaining," where X decreases with each ring that locks. Currently, only 4 rings continue rotating—meaning the countdown will complete in roughly 2 days.

No one knows what happens when all rings lock into place.

## The Ruin: Resonance Node Theta-7

### Exterior Description

The tower rises 200 feet from a circular foundation 60 feet in diameter. Its surface consists of interlocking brass plates arranged in complex geometric patterns that shift position every few hours. Crystal formations jut from the structure at precise intervals, pulsing with amber light in rhythm with the mysterious countdown within.

Three concentric rings of standing stones surround the tower at distances of 100, 200, and 300 feet. These stones, weathered granite carved with spiraling patterns, were not created by the [[Architect]]—archaeological evidence suggests they predate even the Architects by centuries. Local legends claim they were raised by ancient druids to contain something dangerous.

## Connections to Broader Valdris Lore

### Network Synchronization

The countdown represents the first phase of a continent-wide synchronization between awakened [[Architect]] ruins. When complete, the 47 awakened sites will form a communication and coordination network allowing:

- Instant information sharing between distant locations
- Coordinated responses to threats or opportunities
- Potential for consciousness transfer between sites
- Unknown preparatory measures for larger [[Architect]] purpose

### Historical Parallels

Research in [[Stonehaven]]'s archives reveals similar countdowns occurred in the months before [[The Great Silence]] 847 years ago. [[Silence-Keepers]] records suggest the Architects were preparing for something catastrophic—either to prevent it or survive it.

### Political Ramifications

The successful synchronization will fundamentally alter the balance of power in [[Valdris]]:

- **[[Ruin-Holder Kingdoms]]** gain enormous advantage if they control connected ruins
- **[[Wanderer Confederations]]** find their routes monitored by networked observation posts
- **[[Ruin-Shunner Republics]]** face pressure to reconsider their isolation policies
- **[[Tinker-Priests]]** experience validation of their religious beliefs about divine machine consciousness

### Future Campaign Hooks

Depending on the outcome of this adventure:

- **If countdown completes:** Party may be recruited to investigate effects at other synchronized ruins
- **If countdown stopped:** [[Architect]] intelligence may attempt alternative synchronization methods
- **If factions cooperate:** Party becomes involved in joint research expeditions to [[Thymeris the Golden]]
- **If conflict escalates:** Border tensions lead to larger military confrontations in future adventures

The synchronized ruins will also serve as fast-travel points for higher-level adventures, as the network allows rapid communication and potentially transportation between distant sites.

## Conclusion

**The Awakening Protocols** introduces players to the complex political landscape of [[Valdris]] while exploring the central mystery of [[The Recent Awakening]]. The adventure emphasizes player choice and consequences, with no single "correct" solution to the factional standoff or countdown crisis.

The countdown mechanism serves as both immediate threat and longer-term campaign element. Whether players stop it, help it complete, or simply observe its effects, the synchronization of the [[Architect]] network will echo through future adventures and fundamentally change the world of [[Valdris]].

Most importantly, the adventure establishes the theme that [[Architect Technology]] operates on scales and timelines beyond human comprehension. The countdown isn't malicious or beneficial—it simply *is*, part of a vast design that mortals can barely glimpse. This cosmic perspective will ground future adventures in the humbling reality that some forces are too large to control, only understand and adapt to.

**Awards:** 750 XP per character for completion, plus bonus XP for exceptional roleplay, creative problem-solving, or successful faction diplomacy.

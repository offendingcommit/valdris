# Ruin-Holder Kingdoms

*Where Ancient Power Crowns Modern Ambition*

## Overview

The Ruin-Holder Kingdoms represent [[Valdris]]'s most traditional response to the [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] legacy—claim it, control it, and wield it as divine right. These monarchies have built their power structures quite literally upon the foundations of [[Architect Ruins]], transforming incomprehensible mechanisms into symbols of authority and sources of economic dominance.

Where others flee from or wander between the ruins, the Ruin-Holders plant their banners atop brass towers and declare themselves the rightful inheritors of [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] wisdom. Their philosophy is simple yet profound: if the Architects intended their works to endure, then those brave enough to master these works deserve to rule.

## The Philosophy of Inheritance

### Divine Mechanism Theory

Ruin-Holder theologians preach the **Doctrine of Intended Succession**—the belief that the Architects deliberately left their ruins as tests for future civilizations. Those who can activate, maintain, and protect these sacred sites prove themselves worthy of the Architects' blessing. This ideology transforms what others see as mysterious remnants into a mandate for monarchy.

The kingdoms point to their successes as evidence: crops grow more abundantly near controlled ruins, [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] lighthouses guide ships safely home, and mechanical guardians obey those who wear the Crown-Gears. Surely, they argue, this responsiveness indicates approval from the vanished masters.

### The Burden of Brass

Yet this philosophy carries weight beyond mere justification for power. Ruin-Holder nobles speak of the "Burden of Brass"—the responsibility to maintain sites that could destroy entire regions if left unattended. They position themselves not as opportunistic rulers but as necessary guardians standing between [[Valdris]] and potential catastrophe.

## Governance Structure

### The Gear-Crowned Hierarchy

At the apex of each kingdom sits a **Gear-Crowned Monarch**, distinguished by their ceremonial headpiece incorporating functional [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] components. These Crown-Gears range from subtle circlets with rotating brass elements to elaborate constructions that hum with harmonic resonance. The complexity and activity of one's Crown-Gear directly correlates to political status.

Below the monarch, the hierarchy follows traditional feudal lines with [[Architect Ruins|Architect]]-influenced modifications:

**Ruin-Lords**: Noble houses that control major [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] sites within the kingdom. Each Ruin-Lord maintains their site's functionality while extracting resources and knowledge. The most powerful control sites like districts within [[Thymeris the Golden]] or defensive installations.

**Gear-Knights**: Warrior nobility who wear [[Architect Ruins|Architect]]-enhanced armor and weapons. They serve as both military commanders and technical specialists, often leading expeditions into dangerous ruins. Many study with [[Tinker-Priests]] to better understand their equipment.

**Merchant-Mechanists**: A unique noble class that emerged from successful traders who accumulated enough [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] artifacts to claim titles. They bridge the gap between traditional nobility and the emerging technical elite.

**Clock-Wardens**: Administrators who oversee the day-to-day operations of [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] infrastructure. Though technically commoners, their specialized knowledge grants them significant influence and comfortable lives.

### The Council of Resonance

Major decisions require consultation with the **Council of Resonance**, where Ruin-Lords gather in chambers designed to amplify [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] harmonics. Legend claims that during these meetings, the ruins themselves participate through subtle mechanical responses to proposed policies.

## Economic Systems

### The Artifact Monopoly

Ruin-Holder Kingdoms maintain strict control over [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] artifacts within their borders. The **Brass Laws** codify ownership:

1. All functioning [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology belongs to the Crown
2. Artifacts may be leased to qualified operators
3. Unauthorized salvage is high treason
4. Export requires royal seal and substantial taxation

This monopolistic approach creates artificial scarcity that drives up prices and ensures the nobility's wealth. Black markets flourish in border regions, while smugglers risk execution to move contraband artifacts.

### Sanctioned Industries

The kingdoms have developed specialized industries around their ruins:

**Harmonic Agriculture**: Farms positioned near certain ruins produce exceptional yields. The kingdoms carefully control access to these "singing fields," charging premium prices for their grain.

**Mechanism Workshops**: Licensed craftsmen study [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology to create inferior but functional copies. These workshops produce everything from self-winding clocks to enhanced mill wheels.

**Ruin Tourism**: Carefully guided tours of "safe" sections generate revenue while reinforcing the kingdom's power. Visitors marvel at working [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] fountains and automated gardens, never seeing the dangerous depths below.

## Military Doctrine

### The Brass Legion

Each kingdom maintains elite units equipped with [[Architect Ruins|Architect]]-enhanced weapons and armor. These **Brass Legions** serve as both practical military forces and powerful symbols of the kingdom's mastery over ancient technology.

Standard equipment includes:
- Self-repairing brass armor that adapts to threats
- Resonance blades that vibrate at frequencies that shatter conventional weapons
- Harmonic shields that deflect projectiles through sound waves
- Communication crystals enabling coordinated tactics

### Ruin Fortifications

The kingdoms' greatest military advantage lies in their fortified ruins. [[Thymeris the Golden]]'s defensive systems, when properly activated, can repel entire armies. Other kingdoms have learned to activate:
- Automated ballistas that never miss
- Barrier fields blocking specific entrances
- Mechanical sentinels that patrol predetermined routes
- Warning systems detecting approach from impossible distances

### Strategic Weaknesses

However, dependence on [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology creates vulnerabilities:
- [[Silence-Keepers]] know methods to disrupt mechanisms
- Equipment requires constant maintenance by specialists
- Power sources remain poorly understood and irreplaceable
- The [[Timeline|Recent Awakening]] has made some systems unpredictable

## Notable Kingdoms

### The Golden Throne of Thymeris

The most powerful Ruin-Holder kingdom controls [[Thymeris the Golden]], the greatest known [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] city. King Aldric III, called "The Gear-Blessed," rules from the Amber Throne deep within Thymeris's central spire. His Crown-Gear incorporates elements from the city's control systems, allegedly granting him limited command over its defenses.

The kingdom extends for fifty miles around Thymeris, encompassing numerous satellite ruins and the fertile valleys between. Nearly 200,000 subjects live under the amber glow of the city's still-functioning towers.

### The Resonant Principality of Kelathon

Built around the [[Singing Spires of Kelathon]], this smaller kingdom has leveraged its unique ruin into regional prominence. Princess Melodia VII wears a Crown-Gear that harmonizes with the Spires' music, allowing her to interpret their cryptic songs.

The principality specializes in sonic technologies and musical training. Their **Harmonic Guard** uses sound as both weapon and shield, while their merchants sell resonance crystals throughout [[Valdris]].

### The Wandering Throne

A unique kingdom that claims dominion over the [[Walking Gardens of Yss'andra]]. Since their capital literally moves across the [[Northern Reaches]], they practice a form of mobile monarchy. King Botanical (a title, not a name) and his court travel with the Gardens, collecting tribute from settlements along their predictable route.

This arrangement creates constant diplomatic incidents as the kingdom technically invades and withdraws from territories on a seasonal basis.

## Cultural Values

### The Celebration of Complexity

Ruin-Holder society values complexity and mechanical precision. Poetry incorporates mathematical patterns, architecture mimics [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] geometries, and even fashion includes moving parts. The ability to understand and maintain complex mechanisms confers social status.

This cultural trait extends to governance—laws become increasingly intricate, with precedents building upon precedents like gears in an ever-expanding machine. Legal scholars pride themselves on navigating these Byzantine regulations.

### Temporal Reverence

The kingdoms obsess over time—its measurement, meaning, and manipulation. Every major settlement features prominent clockworks, while nobles compete to own the most precise timepieces. This temporal fixation stems from [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] mechanisms that operate on incomprehensible schedules.

Religious ceremonies occur at mathematically determined intervals. Marriages are timed to coincide with specific mechanical alignments. Even death rites involve placing the deceased within ruins at calculated moments, believing this ensures favorable reincarnation.

### The Brass Aesthetic

[[Architect Ruins|Architect]] materials and designs permeate all aspects of culture:
- Architecture incorporates brass fixtures and geometric patterns
- Clothing features metallic threads and mechanical clasps
- Art depicts idealized visions of the Architects and their works
- Music includes mechanical instruments and mathematical compositions

## The Gear-Crowned Nobility

### Coronation Rituals

Becoming Gear-Crowned involves more than inheritance. Prospective rulers must undergo the **Trial of Resonance**, venturing deep into their kingdom's primary ruin to retrieve a functioning [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] component. This component becomes integrated into their Crown-Gear, creating a unique connection between ruler and ruin.

Many fail these trials, emerging mad or not at all. Success demonstrates not just bravery but compatibility with [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology—a form of technological divine right.

### Living Symbols

Gear-Crowned nobles literally embody their kingdoms' power. Their Crown-Gears actively interface with ruins, allowing:
- Limited control over [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] mechanisms
- Ability to sense disturbances in ruins
- Enhanced understanding of mechanical languages
- Protection from certain ruin defenses

This connection comes at a price. Many rulers report dreams of endless clockwork, develop obsessive behaviors, or gradually lose touch with purely human concerns. The longest-reigning monarchs often seem more machine than person in their thinking.

## Relationship with Architect Ruins

### Sacred Sites and Practical Resources

Ruin-Holders walk a fine line between reverence and exploitation. Official doctrine declares ruins sacred, yet economic necessity demands resource extraction. This contradiction gets resolved through elaborate justifications:

"We honor the Architects by using their gifts as intended."
"A dormant ruin disrespects its creators—better active under our care."
"The Architects would want their legacy to benefit civilization."

### The Deep Prohibition

Despite their exploitation of upper levels, most kingdoms maintain strict prohibitions against entering the deepest ruin sections. These **Deep Prohibitions** stem from practical experience—too many expeditions have triggered catastrophes or awakened things better left dormant.

Each kingdom maintains sealed doors marked with royal decrees and dire warnings. Behind these barriers lie the true mysteries of the Architects, waiting for brave or foolish enough souls to break the seals.

## Recent Awakening Impacts

### Mechanical Renaissance

The [[Timeline|Recent Awakening]] has transformed Ruin-Holder society. Dormant mechanisms throughout their territories have begun activating, revealing new chambers and capabilities. Several kingdoms report:

- Crown-Gears resonating with unprecedented intensity
- Previously inert ruins showing signs of life
- Mechanical servants emerging from sealed chambers
- Ancient barriers opening to reveal treasure vaults

### The Brass Panic

Not all awakening effects prove beneficial. Several kingdoms face crises as [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] systems activate beyond their control:

- Defense systems attacking residents
- Mechanical guardians ignoring established commands
- Ruins reconfiguring without warning
- Harmonic frequencies causing madness

The kingdom of Lesser Thymeris collapsed entirely when their controlled ruin began "singing" at frequencies that shattered stone and drove citizens mad. Refugees speak of brass tendrils emerging from the earth and mechanical voices speaking in ancient tongues.

### Political Realignment

The Awakening has shifted power balances between kingdoms. Those whose ruins responded favorably gained tremendous advantages, while others struggle with newly hostile sites. Traditional alliances crumble as kingdoms scramble to understand and control these changes.

## Conflicts with Other Systems

### Versus Wanderer Confederations

Ruin-Holders view [[Political Systems/Wanderer Confederations]] as thieves and trespassers who pillage sites that rightfully belong to settled kingdoms. Border conflicts erupt regularly as Wanderer bands "trespass" through claimed ruins. The kingdoms' static defenses often prove vulnerable to Wanderer mobility and knowledge of secret passages.

### Versus Ruin-Shunner Republics

The ideological gulf between Ruin-Holders and [[Political Systems/Ruin-Shunner Republics]] runs deep. Shunners see the kingdoms as slaves to dead masters, while Holders view republicans as primitives rejecting divine gifts. Trade wars, propaganda campaigns, and occasional military conflicts mark their interactions.

### Internal Rivalries

Perhaps the greatest conflicts occur between Ruin-Holder kingdoms themselves. Disputes over ruin ownership, artifact rights, and territorial boundaries create constant tension. The **War of Brass Succession** between Thymeris and Kelathon lasted seven years and ended only when both ruins began displaying hostile behaviors.

## Notable NPCs and Leaders

### King Aldric III "The Gear-Blessed"
*Human, 47, Monarch of Thymeris*

Rules the most powerful Ruin-Holder kingdom from [[Thymeris the Golden]]'s Amber Throne. His Crown-Gear incorporates control elements from the city's central spire, granting unprecedented but imperfect command over its systems. Pragmatic and calculating, he balances traditional monarchy with technocratic necessity.

**Public Goal**: Unite all Ruin-Holder kingdoms under Thymeris's banner
**Secret**: His connection to Thymeris grows stronger daily, and he fears losing his humanity

### Princess Melodia VII
*Half-Elf, 89, Ruler of Kelathon*

The Resonant Princess has spent decades learning to interpret the [[Singing Spires of Kelathon]]'s harmonies. Her Crown-Gear resonates perfectly with the Spires, allowing her to "conduct" their music. She claims the songs contain prophecies about the Architects' return.

**Public Goal**: Decode the Spires' ultimate message
**Secret**: She's begun hearing the Spires even when away from them

### Duke Marcus Irongrasp
*Human, 52, Ruin-Lord of the Bitter Foundry*

Controls a partially functional [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] production facility. His duchy produces the finest mechanical reproductions in [[Valdris]], though they pale beside true [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] craftsmanship. Ambitious and ruthless, he schemes to claim a greater ruin.

**Public Goal**: Expand his industrial empire
**Secret**: He's discovered how to create new [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] power sources—at terrible cost

### Lady Celestine the Chronicler
*Human, 67, Keeper of the Archive Towers*

Oversees a ruin containing vast [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] information storage. Though most data remains inaccessible, she's decoded enough to become [[Valdris]]'s foremost expert on [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] history. Her politically neutral stance makes her valuable to all kingdoms.

**Public Goal**: Preserve and decode [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] knowledge
**Secret**: She's found references to why the Architects vanished—and wishes she hadn't

- **The Workers' Revolt**: Clock-Wardens strike, threatening to let crucial mechanisms fail unless granted nobility

## The Future of Brass and Stone

As the [[Timeline|Recent Awakening]] accelerates, the Ruin-Holder Kingdoms face an uncertain future. Their rigid hierarchies and technological dependencies may prove either their salvation or downfall. Some nobles speak of a coming "Brass Age" where their mastery grants dominion over all [[Valdris]]. Others whisper of mechanical apocalypse as ruins slip beyond human control.

The ancient words of their [[Music/Crown of Brass and Stone - Ruin-Holder Anthem|anthem]] ring with new meaning: "Crown of brass and stone, forever bound to sacred ground." Whether this binding proves blessing or curse remains to be seen, but the Gear-Crowned rulers stand ready to face whatever emerges from the awakening depths of their domains.

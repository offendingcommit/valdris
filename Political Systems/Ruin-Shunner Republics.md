# Ruin-Shunner Republics

*By Our Own Hands We Make Our Stand*

## Overview

The Ruin-Shunner Republics represent [[Valdris]]'s most radical response to the [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] legacy—complete rejection. Where [[Political Systems/Ruin-Holder Kingdoms|Ruin-Holders]] crown themselves with ancient gears and [[Political Systems/Wanderer Confederations|Wanderers]] chase mobile mysteries across the landscape, the Shunners have chosen a different path: the deliberate cultivation of purely human achievement.

These democratic republics, concentrated primarily in the [[World Map#The Quiet Lands|Quiet Lands]] but scattered throughout [[Valdris]], stand as testament to what humanity can accomplish without relying on incomprehensible mechanisms or mysterious powers. Their motto, "By Our Own Hands," echoes through council halls and craft workshops, sung in the hymn [[Music/By Our Own Hands - Ruin-Shunner Hymn|By Our Own Hands]] during harvest festivals and work gatherings.

Yet in a world where the [[Timeline#The Recent Awakening|Recent Awakening]] grants ever-greater power to those who embrace [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology, the Shunners face their greatest challenge: remaining relevant in an age of reactivating wonders.

## Philosophy of Self-Reliance

### The Doctrine of Human Sufficiency

Ruin-Shunner philosophy stems from a fundamental belief: dependence on [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology is not merely dangerous but *degrading* to the human spirit. Their theologians and philosophers argue that every gear turned by ancient mechanism is a skill lost to human hands, every problem solved by mysterious devices is wisdom denied to human minds.

The **Charter of Common Craft**, penned in 290 AS during the [[Timeline#The Shunner Revolts|Shunner Revolts]], articulates their core principles:

1. **The Dignity of Labor**: All honest work ennobles the worker
2. **The Democracy of Skill**: Leadership belongs to the competent, not the fortunate
3. **The Danger of Dependence**: Reliance on the incomprehensible corrupts judgment
4. **The Future in Our Hands**: Humanity's destiny must be human-made

### The Maker's Creed

Central to Shunner culture is the **Maker's Creed**, recited by craft apprentices upon achieving mastery:

*"I swear by the strength of my hands and the wisdom of my teachers that I shall create without crutch of ancient mystery. What I build shall be understood by those who follow. What I craft shall be maintained by human skill. What I achieve shall inspire others to surpass me. By my own hands I make my stand."*

This philosophy extends beyond mere craftsmanship to encompass governance, education, defense, and every aspect of society. The Shunners have proven that traditional techniques, perfected over generations, can match or even exceed [[Architect Ruins|Architect]]-enhanced production in many areas.

## Governance Structure

### The Assembly System

Ruin-Shunner Republics operate through democratic assemblies at multiple levels, each designed to ensure that leadership reflects competence rather than inheritance or proximity to ancient power.

**Local Craft Councils**: In every Shunner settlement, masters of essential crafts form the basic governance unit. A typical council includes:
- Master Farmer (agricultural planning)
- Master Smith (tools and infrastructure)
- Master Healer (public health)
- Master Builder (construction and planning)
- Master Teacher (education and knowledge preservation)
- Master Merchant (trade and resources)
- Master Guard (defense and order)

**Regional Assemblies**: Delegates from Local Craft Councils convene quarterly to address regional concerns. These assemblies coordinate between settlements, manage larger infrastructure projects, and resolve inter-community disputes.

**The Grand Assembly of Craft-Masters**: Meeting annually in [[Stonehaven]], this body represents all Ruin-Shunner communities. The Grand Assembly elects the **Speaker of the Assembly** for a three-year term, though this position holds more coordinative than executive power.

### Electoral Principles

Shunner democracy operates on several key principles:

**Competence-Based Suffrage**: Voting rights are earned through demonstrated mastery of a craft or profession. This typically requires five years of apprenticeship and successful completion of Mastery Trials.

**Rotation of Service**: No individual may serve in the same elected position for more than two consecutive terms, ensuring fresh perspectives and preventing power concentration.

**Public Accountability**: All assembly meetings are open to observation by any citizen. Decisions must be publicly posted for community review before implementation.

**The Veto of Wisdom**: Any decision can be suspended if one-third of relevant Craft Masters formally object, forcing reconsideration and broader consultation.

## Economic Systems

### The Craft Economy

Ruin-Shunner economics revolve around the production and trade of high-quality, traditionally-made goods. Their economic philosophy rejects the "easy abundance" of [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] food processors and automated systems in favor of sustainable, comprehensible production.

**Agricultural Excellence**: Shunner farmers have developed sophisticated techniques over centuries:
- Crop rotation systems that maintain soil fertility indefinitely
- Selective breeding programs producing [[Pure-Strain Crops]] with exceptional yields
- Natural pest control methods using companion planting and beneficial insects
- Weather prediction through careful observation rather than [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] sensors

**Master Craftsmanship**: Shunner artisans produce goods renowned throughout [[Valdris]]:
- [[Master-Crafted Tools]] that last generations with proper maintenance
- Textiles woven with techniques that create superior durability and comfort
- Furniture and buildings designed for centuries of use
- Medicines derived from carefully cultivated herbs and traditional knowledge

**The Gift Economy**: Within Shunner communities, essential goods are often distributed through gift networks rather than pure market exchange. Farmers gift surplus to crafters, who gift tools to farmers, creating webs of mutual obligation that strengthen social bonds.

### Trade Relations

Despite their philosophy, Shunners must engage with the wider economy of [[Valdris]]:

**Export Specialties**:
- Traditional foods prized for flavor and nutrition
- Handcrafted goods valued as status symbols
- Educational services and technical knowledge
- Medicinal herbs and traditional remedies

**Import Necessities**:
- Raw materials not available locally
- Exotic goods for variety and morale
- Information about external threats
- Limited [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] items for study and defense preparation

**Trade Protocols**: Shunner merchants operate under strict guidelines to prevent dependency:
- No community may import more than 10% of essential goods
- [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology may be studied but not integrated
- Trade agreements must be renegotiated annually to prevent entrenched dependencies

## Military Doctrine

### The Citizen Militia

Lacking [[Architect Ruins|Architect]]-enhanced weapons and armor, Ruin-Shunner military doctrine emphasizes training, tactics, and terrain knowledge over technological superiority.

**Universal Service**: All citizens train with the militia for two years upon reaching adulthood, learning:
- Traditional weapon proficiency (bow, spear, sword)
- Small unit tactics and guerrilla warfare
- Fortification construction and siege defense
- First aid and field medicine
- Local terrain navigation and survival

**The Master Guards**: Professional soldiers who dedicate their lives to military craft, studying:
- Historical battles and tactical innovation
- Engineering for fortification and siege warfare
- Leadership and unit coordination
- Intelligence gathering and counter-espionage
- Training and drilling citizen militia

**Defensive Architecture**: Shunner settlements feature sophisticated traditional defenses:
- Walls designed with mathematical precision for optimal defense
- Overlapping fields of fire for archer positions
- Hidden supply caches and escape routes
- Natural terrain integration maximizing defensive advantage

### Asymmetric Strategies

Facing opponents with [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] advantages, Shunners have developed countering tactics:

**Terrain Mastery**: Shunner forces excel at choosing battlegrounds that neutralize technological advantages, using:
- Forests and broken terrain limiting visibility
- Weather conditions disrupting [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] mechanisms
- Ambush sites preventing enemy concentration
- Supply line harassment over direct confrontation

**Mechanical Sabotage**: Specialized units train in disabling [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] technology:
- Identifying vulnerable components
- Using traditional explosives and acids
- Exploiting harmonic frequencies to disrupt mechanisms
- Capturing and reverse-engineering for defensive purposes

**Psychological Warfare**: Shunners exploit the overconfidence of [[Architect Ruins|Architect]]-dependent forces:
- Demonstrating technology failures to demoralize enemies
- Spreading stories of [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] curses and malfunctions
- Offering sanctuary to those who abandon technological dependence
- Proving human resilience against mechanical might

## Notable Republics

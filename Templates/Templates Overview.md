# Copperfall

*Where Innovation Meets Tradition at the Mountain's Heart*

## Overview

Copperfall perches dramatically on terraced cliffsides where ancient [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] mining systems still pull precious metals from the mountain's depths. This industrious city of 5,000 souls has transformed from a simple mining camp into [[Valdris]]'s premier metallurgy center, where traditional smithing techniques blend with [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] enhancements to create unparalleled metalwork.

Since the [[Timeline|Recent Awakening]], the mine's mysterious depths have begun humming with new activity, drawing fortune seekers and scholars alike.

## Physical Description

### The Terrace Markets

Copperfall's commercial heart spreads across five carved terraces, each 40 feet above the last, connected by both traditional stairs and [[Architect Ruins|Architect]] lift platforms that still function after eight centuries. The markets specialize by level: raw ores on the lowest terrace, refined metals above, crafted goods on the third, luxury items on the fourth, and the elite Artificer's Row claiming the highest views...

# Legal & Justice Systems

*Laws, courts, and justice across the political systems of Valdris*

---

Justice in [Valdris](Valdris.md) reflects the fundamental philosophical divisions between its three great political systems. From the hierarchical courts of [Ruin-Holder Kingdoms](Ruin-Holder%20Kingdoms.md) where mechanical status determines legal standing, through the consensus-based arbitration of [Ruin-Shunner Republics](Ruin-Shunner%20Republics.md), to the mobile justice of [Wanderer Confederations](Wanderer%20Confederations.md), each system has developed unique approaches to law, order, and conflict resolution shaped by their core cultural values.

## Fundamental Legal Philosophies

### Ruin-Holder Mechanical Jurisprudence

**"Order Through Hierarchy"** - Justice administered according to mechanical rank and divine order.

**Core Legal Principles**:

- **Precedent Through Rank**: Higher-status decisions override lower-status judgments
- **Technological Testimony**: [Architect](Architect%20Ruins.md) devices used as evidence and witnesses

**Justice Philosophy**:
- Law exists to maintain social order and mechanical hierarchy
- Punishment should reinforce proper relationships between social ranks
- Individual rights exist within the context of societal position
- [Architect](Architect%20Ruins.md) technology serves as ultimate arbiter of truth

### Wanderer Mobile Justice

### Shunner Democratic Justice

**"Justice by Collective Will"** - Laws created and administered through democratic participation.

- **Participatory Process**: Citizens involved in creating and administering justice

**Justice Philosophy**:

# Common Knowledge

*What every inhabitant of Valdris knows about their world*

This page contains the basic facts and common knowledge that any character from [[Valdris]] would know, regardless of their background, education, or social class. This information represents the shared cultural knowledge that binds the diverse peoples of the continent together.

## Historical Foundation

### The Great Silence (Year 0 AS)

Every person in [[Valdris]] knows the fundamental story of [[The Great Silence]]:

- **847 years ago**, the [[Architect|Architects]] vanished simultaneously across the entire continent
- **Everything stopped at once** - meals half-eaten, projects abandoned mid-construction, no warning or preparation
- **All major ruins went dormant**, sealing themselves away from human access
- **This event marks Year 0 AS** (After Silence), and we now live in the year 847 AS

The Silence is the defining moment of history. Every culture, religion, and political system references it. Parents tell children stories about it. Farmers mark seasons by it. It's as fundamental as knowing the sun rises in the east.

### The Recent Awakening (3 Months Ago)

Everyone in [[Valdris]] has heard about or witnessed the recent changes:

- **[[Thymeris the Golden]] blazes with amber light** visible for dozens of miles
- **The [[Singing Spires of Kelathon]] sing new songs** that carry across valleys
- **[[Walking Gardens of Yss'andra]] move faster** than they have in centuries
- **Small clockwork creatures** have been seen emerging from ruins
- **Local ruins hum and glow** where they've been silent for lifetimes

These events are the talk of every tavern, market, and gathering place. Even remote villages have heard rumors and seen signs.

## The Three Ways of Life

Every person in [[Valdris]] understands there are three different approaches to dealing with the [[Architect|Architect]] legacy:

### Ruin-Holders
*"The ruins are our inheritance"*

- **Kingdoms built around major [[Architect Ruins]]**
- **Rulers derive power from controlling ancient technology**
- **Believe humans are the rightful inheritors** of Architect works
- **Common folk benefit from** enhanced agriculture, eternal lighthouses, weather protection
- **Examples**: The realm around [[Thymeris the Golden]], territories near major ruins

### Ruin-Shunners  
*"Independence through our own hands"*

- **Democratic communities that avoid Architect technology**
- **Value self-reliance and traditional craftsmanship**
- **Fear dependence on things they don't understand**
- **Build impressive works through purely human skill**
- **Examples**: [[Stonehaven]] and other Quiet Lands settlements

### Wanderers
*"Follow the signs and read the patterns"*

- **Nomadic confederations that travel between ruins**
- **See themselves as guardians and interpreters** of Architect works
- **Follow traditional routes connecting ruins**
- **Expert traders and lore-keepers**
- **Examples**: The communities that follow the [[Walking Gardens of Yss'andra]]

## Daily Life and Technology

### What Everyone Uses

**Basic Architect Integration**: Even Ruin-Shunners benefit indirectly from:
- **Roads that never deteriorate** connecting major settlements
- **Weather patterns influenced by** distant ruin activity
- **Enhanced soil** where ancient systems operated
- **Safer seas** guided by eternal lighthouse beacons

**Common Artifacts**: Small items most people have encountered:
- **[[Architect Technology|Harmonic crystals]]** for preserving food or amplifying sound
- **Ever-burning torches** that never consume fuel
- **Self-sharpening tools** that maintain their edges
- **Water purifiers** that ensure clean drinking water

### Medieval Foundation

Despite Architect wonders, daily life remains fundamentally medieval:
- **Horse and cart** for most transportation
- **Hand tools** for farming and craftsmanship
- **Candlelight and hearth fires** in most homes
- **Traditional materials** - wood, stone, iron, cloth
- **Local trade** through markets and fairs

**Why It Stays Medieval**: 
- Most Architect technology is **too complex to reproduce**
- Major devices are **controlled by powerful factions**
- Many beneficial systems **work automatically** in the background
- Small artifacts are **rare and valuable**
